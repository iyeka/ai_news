      "{'title': 'Vercel now supports MCP hosting', 'content': \"On May 7th, Vercel officially announced MCP server support on Vercel hosting. Vercel is the owner of Next.js, the popular open source React framework. They also offers cloud hosting for Next.js, along with it‚Äôs [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) feature, it‚Äôs serverless backend like AWS Lambda. Before this announcement, our team tried hosting MCPs on Vercel, but failed. At the time, most cloud platforms had troubles supporting SSE capability. With this new announcement, MCP hosting is finally coming to Vercel hosted using Vercel Functions.\\n\\n# How do I set it up\\n\\nThe MCP is set up through Next.js‚Äô Vercel Functions. A great place to start is by looking at or deploying the [official Vercel MCP + Next.js demo](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/model-context-protocol-mcp-with-next-js). Vercel is known for it‚Äôs one click deploy experience, so this is a good way to dive right in and see it work.\\n\\nThe official docs explain it best and in detail, but the TLDR is that you set it up in the serverless function via the `app/api/[transport]` route. Setting it up this way deploys your endpoints for MCP. You can take the setup one step better by setting up [Fluid Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/fluid-compute), optimizing server usage once you scale.\\n\\n# The vercel/mcp-adapter\\n\\nThe [vercel/mcp-adapter](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-adapter) SDK is the official Typescript SDK for MCP hosting on Vercel. Under the hood, the adapter is just a wrapper around the Anthropic `@ modelcontextprotocol` Typescript SDK that optimizes for hosting on Vercel. Setting up the server is as easy as it gets. You create the `createMcpHandler` object from the adapter and run it. This sets up the MCPs on Vercel serverless functions. \\n\\n     const handler = createMcpHandler(\\n      server => {\\n        server.tool(\\n          'roll_dice',\\n          'Rolls an N-sided die',\\n          { sides: z.number().int().min(2) },\\n          async ({ sides }) => {\\n            const value = 1 + Math.floor(Math.random() * sides);\\n            return {\\n              content: [{ type: 'text', text: `üé≤ You rolled a ${value}!` }],\\n            };\\n          }\\n        );\\n      },\\n      {\\n        // Optional server options\\n      },\\n      {\\n        // Optional configuration\\n        redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,\\n        // Set the basePath to where the handler is to automatically derive all endpoints\\n        // This base path is for if this snippet is located at: /app/api/[transport]/route.ts\\n        basePath: '/api',\\n        maxDuration: 60,\\n        verboseLogs: true,\\n      }\\n    );\\n    export { handler as GET, handler as POST };\\n    \\n\\nIf you want to use SSE instead of streamable HTTP, you must add a redis URL to enable that configuration. Other than the configuration, setting up the tool is like any other existing solution. This adapter was only launched 5 days ago. It is owned officially owned by Vercell, but always be cautious when using new and immature projects.\\n\\n# Why this is big for MCPs\\n\\nIn the early stages of MCPs, we didn‚Äôt see a lot of great ways to host MCPs. The earliest player in remote MCP hosting was Cloudflare, who introduced their [McpAgent](https://blog.cloudflare.com/remote-model-context-protocol-servers-mcp/). They were the first to offer one click ‚ÄúDeploy to Cloudflare‚Äù options for MCP, which is what Vercel was known for with Next.js. However, many developers aren‚Äôt familiar with hosting on Cloudflare, and it wasn‚Äôt clear for developers on how to host on the popular services like AWS.\\n\\nVercel MCP hosting is a game changer. Next.js is one of the most popular web frameworks, so developers with some understanding of Next.js and Vercel ecosystem could easily spin up an MCP server. We also appreciate Vercel‚Äôs decision to focus on Streamable HTTP in the SDK, while still allowing SSE as a choice.\", 'link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1kkvsnd/vercel_now_supports_mcp_hosting/'}\n",
