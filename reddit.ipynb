It’s designed to work wherever you want — on-premise, in the cloud, or inside Docker containers.\\n\\nHere’s a quick rundown of what it can do:\\n\\n* Manage multiple FFmpeg jobs with a queueing system\\n* Use dynamic wildcards for output filenames\\n* Get real-time webhook notifications to hook into your workflows\\n* Automatically watch folders and process new files\\n* Run custom pre- and post-processing scripts\\n* Simplify common tasks with preconfigured presets\\n* Monitor and control everything through a neat web UI\\n\\nWe’re releasing this as fully open-source because we want to build a\\xa0[community](https://discord.gg/ef6gQGr2)\\xa0around it, get feedback, and keep improving.\\n\\nIf you’re interested, check it out here:\\n\\nWebsite:\\xa0[https://ffmate.io](https://ffmate.io/)  \\nGitHub:\\xa0[https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate](https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate)\\n\\nWould love to hear what you think — and especially: what’s your biggest FFmpeg pain point that you wish was easier to handle?',\n",

       "  'content': 'Everyone wants their own AI Agents, but very few have the time, energy and background to build, test and deploy them from scratch.\\n\\nExisting solutions are to either write everything from scratch (as well as managing the test environment, establishing the infra, etc.) or they are stuck with drag&drop flow builders which have existed for over 10 years. They are a patchwork of solutions; \"AI-added\" instead of \"AI-first\", they come with pre-defined logic (blocks) that you can\\'t step out of. Worst of all, they are in an integrations arms race to see who has the most, forcing users to frequently switch to different products because they are bound by the integrations offered by the platform.\\n\\nUsers have two choices: Learn how to code and do everything yourself, or sit through many tutorial videos and documentations to accomplish a basic flow in a flow builder.\\n\\nIn our former business where we built enterprise-level vertical AI Agents, we were also frustrated. Our devs were wasting valuable time doing everything manually, and I couldn\\'t help them out because I never had the time to become Professor Emeritus in n8n. So we developed an internal tool, and only later realized its true potential.\\n\\n**The future isn\\'t a better drag&drop, it is the complete elimination of it.**\\n\\n**If people can vibe-code entire apps from scratch, why can\\'t they vibe-build entire multi-agent systems from scratch?**\\xa0Agents in code are objectively more capable, so why restrain oneself with the flow automation logic of the past decade?\\n\\nThat\\'s why\\xa0we decided to offer **Demiurg**\\xa0for everyone: To provide a platform where users can vibe-build the multi-agent system they want using natural language. No drag&drop, everything in code, everything manually editable, or otherwise promptable. Here is how it works (and how every other builder will work in the future!)\\n\\n1. User describes the type of Agent they want\\n2. Demiurg writes the code from scratch\\n3. Users can test immediately. If they are not satisfied, user can edit the code manually, or ask for a redraft\\n4. They can deploy the Agent instantly; publicly or privately. Public agents can be sent to anyone, or they can be used as blueprints for other users\\n5. And that\\'s it\\n\\nOther platforms that promote \"building AI Agents using natural language prompting\" miss one crucial element.\\xa0**They still depend on ordering pre-defined blocks!**\\xa0Demiurg, on the other hand, writes the code from scratch, offering truly limitless capabilities.\\n\\nYou want a financial analyst that looks up stock prices and executes based on your inputs from Telegram?\\xa0**We can one-shot it.**\\n\\nYou want a content generation pipeline, from research to drafts to posting, with its own database, that acts based on what you write in a Slack channel?\\xa0**Should take about 10 minutes.**\\n\\nThe possibilities are endless for deploying truly autonomous, truly capable multi-agent systems that enables\\xa0**everyone**\\xa0to harness the power and liberty that comes with having one\\'s own AI Agents.\\n\\nI wanted to share this with you to gauge your interest in such a solution, and whether you\\'ve had the same problems as we had while orchestrating agentic AI systems.\\n\\n**Our Waitlist is open, drop a comment and I\\'ll guide you there!** Very curious to hear your opinion and answer your questions!\\n\\n[Demiurg transforms user prompts into code-native, multi-agent AI systems and completely streamlines the experience for orchestrating AI Agents for devs and non-devs alike.](https://reddit.com/link/1kmfzx3/video/6m8n52ux7r0f1/player)\\n\\n',\n",
